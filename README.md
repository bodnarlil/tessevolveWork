# tessevolveWork
this is the repository for my work on the tessevolve project
- checkboxes and sliders instead of drop-down menu items

      + create checkboxes and sliders
      + connect them to the main page to get them to do something
      + connect them to the tessevolve project and have them do something there
- combining the .csv data files

      + get all the files combined within the three dimensions
      + connect all three dimensions

first, get the checkboxes to work on the main file. second, focus on changing out the csv files
